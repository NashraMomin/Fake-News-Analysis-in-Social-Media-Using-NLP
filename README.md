## 📖 Introduction
Fake news on social media has significant implications for public opinion and democracy. This project utilizes NLP to detect and analyze fake news, providing a valuable tool for mitigating misinformation.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from News Dataset. It includes a variety of real and fake news articles.

## 🔍 Model
We utilize a Naive Bayes classifier, vectorizing the text using TF-IDF to detect fake news. The model is trained on labeled news articles and tested to ensure accuracy.

## 📊 Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the validation set. Confusion matrices and accuracy scores are provided for deeper insight into model performance.
